		An Improved Exchange Format for WOCE Hydrographic Program Data Files
	</b>
</div>
<br />
<p>
	The original WHP formats for both CTD and bottle data have been a problem to produce. The descriptions are vague, leading to inconsistencies that have caused difficulties for both the WHPO and data users. <br />
	<br />
	We have created a self-describing data exchange format, combining the most relevant information from the summary (*.SUM) files with the parameter names, units and values from the CTD and bottle files. The result is a single, sensible, comma separated value ASCII file for each data type that should alleviate the problems asscociated with reading the WOCE hydrographic data.
