	(<b>Includes Country Code, Ship Code, Expedition Designation/Leg</b>) Due to the number of cruises involved, a unique identifier
	is required for all WOCE cruises.  To provide such identification, please use the following procedure to form the requisite
	Mnemonic.
	<br>
	The first 4 characters are the US National Oceanographic Data
	Center (NODC) country ship code.  The US NODC country codes
	are defined in Table 3.6.  Note that the country code is 
	associated with the country of origin for the ship.  That
	may be different from the country actually conducting the 
	cruise.  The US NODC ship code can normally be obtained
	from OCEANIC.  If you cannot obtain the ship code from there,
	the WHPO can provide the proper code for you. <br>
	The country-ship code is followed by up to an 8 character
	expedition name or cruise number and the leg (default = 1)
	of the cruise is appended after the _ (underscore) symbol.  The
	expedition name or cruise number is normally assigned by the ship
	operator and their conventions should be used.  For example,
	German cruises are designated by a number and leg while French
	cruises are usually given a name.  Thus, a name should not be given
	in the EXPOCODE for a German cruise.  Further, some countries 
	designate their cruises by a number but that number is reset
	to 1 every year.  In such cases the year should be included
	with the cruise number, for example, the 9th cruise of the R/V 
	<i>A. von Humboldt</i> in 1991 would be given cruise number 991 in the 
	EXPOCODE to ensure uniqueness. <br>

	An alias for the cruise may be fiven in the -.DOC file and will
	be retained with the netadata for the cruise.  For formatting 
	reasons, the expedition name is limited toeight (8) characters. 
	Therefore, if necessary, the expedition name should be abbreviated to
	8 characters for the EXPOCODE, but will be carried full length with 
	the metadata.  The EXPOCODE is also used in the water sample (-.SEA)
	and -.CTD files to tie these files to the -.SUM file in order to 
	uniquely identify the cruise or expedition in those files.

	The WHP Section designator.  Section designations were originally assigned in the WOCE Implementation Plan.  However, many sections
	have been added or modified since then.   If you have a question about the section designation for the work that you are
	doing, please contact the WHPO.
	<br>

	Many one-time sections are broken into segments that are often done by different invesigators on different ships.  To account for this the WHPO
	frequently assigns suffixes to the section designator to distinguish
	among these segments.  The same is true for some repeat sections as well.  If a suffix has been assigned to your segment (this information is available
	from the WHPO or via OCEANIC) it would be appreciated if that identification is included in the WHP-ID.  Also, in order for sort routines in a database to work correctly it is necessary that all section numbers be the same length, which requires a leading zero for single digit sections.  That is, section P1 sould be written as P01, AR5, is AR05, and so on.<br>
	If stations are taken on a cruise that are not associated with a WHP section then this field should be left blank in the -.SUM file.

	Whenever possible the station numbering should be continuous for each section, i.e., station numbers should not be reset at the beginning of each leg of long WHP cruises carried out with multiple legs.  Repeat and time series cruises often use the same station number(s) on sequential cruises and that presents no difficulties as long as each cruise is given a unique EXPOCODE.  In order to guage the accuracy of the station position we ask that position, time, and the uncorrected depth be given in the -.SUM file for the beginning, bottom, and end of every hydrographic cast.  That allows an estimate of the ship drift during the station and whether or not the ship drifted across significant topography during the station.

Cast Numbers and Type (right justify)The cast numbers are
sequential and preferably numbered from 1 to n at each
station position. Every over-the-side operation or discrete
sampling at a station is assigned a sequential cast number.
The cast type is a three-character description, for
example, ROSette water samples plus CTD (ROS), Large Volume
Samples (LVS); CTD only (CTD) including fast fish CTD
launches; etc. A complete list of cast types is given in
Table3.5. If any other abbreviations for cast types are
necessary an explanation and definition of such
abbreviations must be included in the cruise report (.DOC
file) and in the text file accompanying the CTD and water
sample data file. <br>If a station is reoccupied during the
same cruise, and the same station number is used, the cast
numbers should increment upward from the last cast number
at the same station. In no case should two records in the
.SUM file contain the same STNNBR and CASTNO on the same
cruise.

The uncorrected acoustic sounding in meters
assuming a sound velocity of 1,500m/s should be noted for
each time and position recorded. For most casts the depth
and position should be recorded at the beginning, bottom,
and end of the cast. Corrections should be made only for
the depth of the acoustic transducer beneath the ocean
surface, or if the echo sounder assumed a sound velocity
different than 1500 m/s. The WHPO will provide a corrected
water depth for the station, based on Carter Tables, in the
Data Reports and the .SUM file available from SAC. <br>If the
depth reading is questionable, some estimate of uncertainty
should be given in the bathymetry section of the cruise
report (.DOC file). <br>The WHPO adds a corrected depth column
adjacent to the uncorrected depth before sending the final
.SUM file to the SAC.
