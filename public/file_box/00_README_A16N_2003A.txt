## Subject: A16N CTD data
## 
## Steve,
## 
## There is a file for you on our anonymous FTP site,
## ftp.pmel.noaa.gov, under /ctd/woce/a16n. It's called a16n_allo.clb
## and it is the preliminary calibrated discrete CTD measurements and
## associated sample salinities and oxygens.
## 
## In generating this file, I found an error I had made in applying
## the preliminary calibrations to the profile data.  The .ctd files
## now on our FTP site are correct and should be downloaded again.  I
## apologize for this oversight.  And I changed the expocode in the
## header to be a 13-character string instead of a 12-character
## string as it is on the WHPO website (e.g. suffix '_01' instead of
## '_1').
## 
## Let me know if you have any questions, 
## Kristy

## 
## Thank you very much Sarilee. Did you make a new exchange file as well?
## 
## Could you check A16N_2003a files? I've sent the final carbon-related data 
## (TCARBN (or TCO2), ALKALI, pH, and pCO2) for this section on 12/10/2004 to 
## WHPO but did not see any changes in your files. When you merge these data, 
## please make sure that you merge all four parameters, because from the first 
## look it seems like TCARBN and pH are the same, but in reality we PIs changed 
## some numbers and flags for both.
## Best,
## Alex.

# Hi Steve,
# I tried to submitt some files to CCHDO through your web site, but it would not 
# work, it would ask me to complete the form, but form was completely 
# completed :-) and I did not know what it wanted from me. So, the attached 
# file is the final and public DOC and TDN data measured during the A16N_2003a 
# cruise (33RO200306_01_02). Could you please merge these data and their 
# quality flags into the main hydrographic files. Please, let me know when the 
# updated files will be available online.
# Thank you,
# Alex.
