<h3> <big>2.0 Using ncBrowse to read netCDF file</big> </h3>
   
<p></p>
     
<p>This command is a Java application and can be obtained at (<a href="http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/">
   http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/</a>
   ). This command allows the contents of variables, global attributes to 
be  viewed graphically. It can run on UNIX (and linux), Windows and Macintosh's
 (Mac OSX) which have the Java Virtual Machine installed (see the above web
 site or the Java web sites&nbsp; <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2">
   http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2</a>
  , <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/</a>
  ) . </p>
   
<p>NcBrowse has been extended over the earlier versions. &nbsp;It now works
 with both <a href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">
  COARDS</a>
   and <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/epic/document/convention.htm">EPIC</a>
   compliant netcdf files. &nbsp;The WOCE Global Data V3 set are COARDS compliant
 and therefore should allow the automatic display of plot elements such as
 labels and variable names and units.&nbsp; The interface is largely self
explanatory and provides wonderful method for browsing generic netCDF files.
</p>
   
<h3>2.1 Exporting netcdf files</h3>
   
<p>&nbsp;ncBrowse allows the user to export parts (or all) of a file in the
 same format as the ncdump command (described elsewhere in this document).
 &nbsp;Thus, for many users who require the analysis of relatively few data
 files , ncBrowse can provide the first quick look at the WOCE, and should
 the data require further calculation allow export of the data to a flat
ascii  file. </p>
   
<h3>&nbsp;2.2 OPenDAP files (formerly DODS)</h3>
   
<p>The WOCE Global Data V3 data are also to be delivered over the world wide
 web. &nbsp;ncBrowse also includes the capability to browse the WOCE netcdf
 files over the web using the <a href="http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods">
  OPenDAP</a>
   protocol (formerly know as DODS). &nbsp;This feature means that the WOCE
 Global Data V3 data set does not need to be resident on your local hardware.
 <br>
  </p>
   
<p>Installation of JAVA is straightforward under Windows and Linux (Redhat
 7.1) and ncBrowse installs very easily on top of this. <br>
  </p>
   
<p>This product is well worth installing and using for the quick plotting
 and export of&nbsp; netCDF files as part of the <br>
  WOCE Global Data V3.</p>
