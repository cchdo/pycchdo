<p><font size="4"><b>7.0 Other methods and examining netCDF files</b></font></p>
       
<p>Obtaining ascii output of a netcdf file is possible. &nbsp;There are several
 methods. First is to use ncdump or ncBrowse. &nbsp;Both ncdump and ncBrowse
 produce the ascii output in the same format. &nbsp;However this format is
 not particularly friendly if you want to import the data to a spreadsheet
such as Excel. &nbsp;The second method is to use Ferret, MATLAB or IDL. &nbsp;An
 example is given from Ferret below. &nbsp;The third method is to use publicly
 available routines such as <a href="http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/%7Ecids/software/visual.html">
  cdf2asc</a>
   or <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/Contrib.html">
nc2text</a>
   commands. I have not tested either of these routines. &nbsp;<br>
  </p>
   
<p><b>7.1 ncdump</b></p>
       
<p>This utility is a very useful program for those who do not have Matlab,
 IDL, Ferret, or ncBrowse and want to check the attributes and obtain the
data from a netCDF file. On unix machines the man pages describe this command
in detail (and its partner ncgen) or in the netCDF User's Guide for Fortran,
 (Chapter 10). To obtain the attributes of the current meter data one would</p>
       
<p>&gt;ncdump -h rcm00683.cdf</p>
       
<p><a href="Appendix_ncdump.html">Appendix 3</a>
   shows the output from this command. To obtain the speed data in this file
  </p>
       
<p>&gt;ncdump -v speed rcm00683.cdf</p>
       
<p>or to obtain the speed and the direction data  </p>
       
<p>&gt;ncdump -v speed,direction rcm00683.cdf</p>
       
<p>The last command can lead to large files ascii files, but have a relatively 
 simple structure and can be read by programs. However, the value of ncdump 
 is that it allows one to check attributes and structure of netcdf files quickly
 and easily. A more convenient way to examine netCDF files is too be able
to visualize the data using a graphical interface such as ncBrowse or Ferret.</p>
   
<h4>7.2 Using Ferret to create ascii files</h4>
   
<p>Ferret has the capability to read netcdf file directly, and it also has
 the capability to export variables in ascii format from a netcdf file. For
 example the ferret commands</p>
   
<pre>USE sst05d19900108.nc<br>SHADE/X=0.25E:363.25E/Y=89.75S:89.75N SEA_SURFACE_TEMPERATURE[d=sst05d19900108.nc]<br>LIST/X=0.25E:363.25E/Y=0S/file=sea_surface_temperature SEA_SURFACE_TEMPERATURE[d=sst05d19900108.nc]<br>QUIT<br></pre>
   
<p>will use the sea surface temperature netcdf file &nbsp;(USE command),
plot its contours (SHADE), and list the sea surface temperature field along
the equator around the world to the file called &nbsp;sea_surface_temperature
 (LIST).</p>
   
<p>The output of the LIST command in this case is a more friendly format
than the output from ncdump, and can be imported into spreadsheet programs
like excel, staroffice or gnumeric.</p>
   
<pre>             sea surface temperature (1/100 degree C)<br>             LATITUDE: 0 (interpolated)<br>             DATA SET: ./sst05d19900108.nc<br> 0.25E   /   1:  32767.<br> 0.75E   /   2:  32767.<br> 1.25E   /   3:  17644.<br> 1.75E   /   4:  32767.<br> 2.25E   /   5:  32767.<br> 2.75E   /   6:  17704.<br> 3.25E   /   7:  32767.<br> 3.75E   /   8:  32767.<br> 4.25E   /   9:  32767.<br> 4.75E   /  10:  32767.<br><br></pre>
   
<p>to <br>
  </p>
   
<pre><br> 0.25W   / 720:  17711.<br> 0.25E   / 721:  32767.<br> 0.75E   / 722:  32767.<br> 1.25E   / 723:  17644.<br> 1.75E   / 724:  32767.<br> 2.25E   / 725:  32767.<br> 2.75E   / 726:  17704.<br> 3.25E   / 727:  32767.</pre>
   
<p>Note that ferret cannot list a large number of columns to a file, and
thus the size of two dimensional arrays that are LISTed to a file is limited.<br>
