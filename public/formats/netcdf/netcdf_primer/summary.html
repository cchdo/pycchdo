 <b><font size="4">Summary</font></b></p>
 
<p>This document describes some simple tools that are available for the reading
of netCDF files found in the WOCE Global Data set Vol. 3. These tools allow
the netCDF files to be read quickly and easily and to be manipulated by many
common analysis packages such as ncBrowse and ferret&nbsp; in addition to 
traditional languages such as Fortran and C/C++ and Java. Because netCDF
format is now used for all of the different data products on the WOCE Global
Data V3.0, the skills required to read one data set are the same as those
needed to read all the others data sets. This reduces the hurdles involved
in reading all the different data sets and allows the analyst to concentrate
on the interpretation of the observations from many different sources. Because
the netCDF files are self-describing, the attributes of each variable (such
as units) and name are defined in the data set (along with other information 
such as the source, creation date, investigator, position, etc etc). This
documentation preserves much of the original information in the data set
reducing the chance of errors occurring during analysis.</p>
