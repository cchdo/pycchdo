The ANDREX recovery cruise (JR239) will take place from 18 March 2010 (Montevideo, Uruguay) to 25 April 2010 (Stanley, Falkland Islands) on the RRS James Clark Ross. This follows on from the original ANDREX cruise that took place from 26 December 2008 (Cape Town, South Africa) to 30 January 2009 (Punta Arenas, Chile) on the RRS James Cook but was curtailed early after the sampling of 27 stations.
