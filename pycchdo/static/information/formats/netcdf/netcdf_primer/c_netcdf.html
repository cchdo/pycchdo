<p><font size="4"><b>6.0 Using C to read netCDF files</b></font></p>
 
<p>The simplest way to create the C code you need to read a netCDF is to
use the C programs cdf2c.c (at the above site or <a href="http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/%7Ecids/software/visual.html">
http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/~cids/software/visual.html</a>
). This program reads a netCDF file and creates another C program with the
required calls to the netCDF libraries. This machine generated program only
needs to be compiled (with correct include file and netCDF libraries). When
executed this code fragment can then read the netCDF file and is ready for
the C code to be added to undertake the analysis required by the user. The
procedure for installing and compiling is described in the documentation
from the web site listed above and is similar in operation to the cdf2fortran
program described above.</p>
