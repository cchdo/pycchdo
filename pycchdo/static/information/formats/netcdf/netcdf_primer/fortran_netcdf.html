<p><font size="4"><b>5.0 Using FORTRAN to read neCDF files</b></font></p>
   
<p>The simplest way to create the Fortran code you need to read a netCDF is
to use the fortran programs cdf2fortran.f (at the above site or <a href="http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/%7Ecids/software/visual.html">
 http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/~cids/software/visual.html</a>
 ) or gennet.for (<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/contrib.html"><font size="2">
 www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/contrib.html</font></a>
  and <a href="http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/WOCE/html/wcdtools.htm">http://www.coaps.fsu.edu/WOCE/html/wcdtools.htm</a>
 ). These programs read a netCDF file and create another fortran program
with the required calls to the netCDF libraries. This machine generated program 
only needs to be compiled (with the correct include file and netCDF libraries). 
When executed this code fragment can then read the netCDF file and is ready 
for the fortran code to be added to undertake the analysis required by the 
user. The variable names reflect the internal structure of the netCDF file 
and this machine generated code is quite readable by humans.  </p>
   
<p><b>5.1 Worked example of cdf2fortran</b></p>
   
<p>The cdf2fortran.f code has been tested on the samples of the netCDF files 
for the WOCE Global Data V2. Retrieve cdf2fortran tar file and use the make 
file to compile the code. You will have to check that the include directory 
and the LIBS directory are correct for your particular installation of the 
netCDF libraries. For Windows machines some extra work may be needed to get 
these routines to compile.&nbsp; On Unix/Linux machines to compile cdf2fortran 
just type</p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt; make cdf2fortran </font> </p>
   
<p>To execute the cdf2fortran code</p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt; cdf2fortran rcm00683.cdf</font></p>
   
<p><font size="1">Generated fortran program called readnet.f</font></p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt;</font></p>
   
<p>Either edit readnet.f file and correct the "include 'netcdf.inc'" file 
for your particular installation and compile</p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt; f77 readnet.f </font> </p>
   
<p>or compile using the -I option to get the correct include file and the 
-l option to get the correct library files  </p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt; f77 -c readnet.f -I/usr/local/netcdf/include</font></p>
   
<p><font size="1">&gt; f77 -o readnet readnet.o -l/usr/local/netcdf/lib/libnetcdf.a</font></p>
   
<p>Sometimes there is a problem at compilation because the variable names 
may have the same name as a parameter name (eg Dimension time(time)). &nbsp;Changing 
the parameter name fixes this problem and now you should have a complete
fortran code able to read your particular netCDF file. The result of compiling
the above for a sample of the curent meter data on WOCE Global Data CD ROM2
is shown in <a href="Appendix_readnet.for.html">Appendix 1</a>
  but is equally applicable to the netcdf files in WOCE Global Data V3. </p>
 
<p>Although this piece of code is quite long (compared to the examples shown 
below) it is reliable and is quick to develop compared reading files that 
are not self-describing (eg plain ascii files). The sample code fragment can
be generalised to read the netCDF data for all of the different current meter
data. The program gennet.for works in a very similar way and produces a slightly
better documented fortran code. See <a href="Appendix_bug_gennet.html"> Appendix
4</a>
  for fixing a bug in the readnet.for programs created by gennet.for.</p>
