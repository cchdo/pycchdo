<p><font size="4"><b>4.0 Using IDL to read netCDF files</b></font></p>
 
<p>IDL can read netCDF files and specifically has a browser to do this (see
page 137 of What's new in IDL 5.3). In addition IDL has specific routines
for reading netCDF files. However, the simplest way to create the IDL code
you need to read a netCDF file is to use the IDL programs cdf2idl (at the
above site or <a href="http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/%7Ecids/software/visual.html">
http://www-c4.ucsd.edu/~cids/software/visual.html</a>
). The concept of this program is similar cdf2fortran.f, cdf2c.c, and cdf2asc.c
programs and is provided by the same group (C4 Interactive Display System).
This program reads a netCDF file and creates another IDL script which can
read the netCDF file.  </p>
 
<p><b>4.1 Example of using cdf2idl</b></p>
 
<p>From within IDL all you need to do, to read the current meter data file
shown for the cdf2fortran example is</p>
 
<p><font size="1">IDL&gt; .run cdf2idl.pro</font></p>
 
<p><font size="1">IDL&gt; cdf2idl, 'rcm00683.cdf'</font></p>
 
<p><font size="1">IDL&gt; @script.idl</font></p>
 
<p>At the completion of this script all of the current meter data are in
memory ready to be analysed. A total of 3 lines of IDL code needed to read
this data set. These three lines of code are so general that they will actually
read any of the netCDF files from any of the WOCE Data Assembly Centres provided
as part of the WOCE Global Data V3.0.</p>
