<p><font size="4"><b>1.0 Why use netCDF for CD ROM 3.0 of WOCE Global Data 
 set?</b></font></p>
       
<p>All of the WOCE Global Data is now in netCDF format. This data format
has many advantages. The most important of which is that it is a self describing, 
  meaning that software packages can directly read the data and determine 
its  structure, the variables names and essential metadata such as the units. 
 This self describing aspect of netCDF file format means that the information 
 needed to ensure accurate work (i.e. reducing the incidence of errors) is 
available   with the data itself. Secondly, it means that programs describe 
below can   read a netCDF file and generate the code needed to read the file 
whether  it be Fortran, C/C++, JAVA or PERL. Thirdly, plotting and analysis 
packages  (e.g. Ferret, IDL, MATLAB) can directly read the netCDF files for 
plotting or analysis. In many of these packages the axes can be labeled without
 intervention from the user</p>
       
<p>Although there is an initial learning curve for the inexperienced netCDF 
  user, high efficiency in reading netCDF files and multiple data can be readily
  achieved as shown in the examples below. These savings translate to more
 time for analyzing data and addressing the synthesis of the WOCE Global
Data.   </p>
       
<p>I have assumed that netCDF libraries have already been installed on your 
  system. They can be obtained from <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/Software.html"><font size="2">
   www.unidata.ucar.edu/Software.html</font></a>
      or <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html"><font size="2">
   www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html</font> </a>
   and are available for Unix, Windows and Macintosh based systems. This
site  also contains excellent description of the Fortran (also Fortran 90),
JAVA  and PERL interfaces for netCDF files. Freely available and commercial
software  that uses netCDF for input are also listed at these sites and includes
products  such as Ferret,  GMT and GrADs and commercial products such as
MATLAB, NCAR  Graphics, IDL and others. Here we focus on reading netCDF files
with ncBrowse,  Matlab, IDL, Fortran, C,&nbsp; ncdump, and Ferret.</p>
       
<p>The WOCE Global Data V3 are now in a <a href="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html">
  COARDS</a>
   compliant format. &nbsp;This means that the variables names associated 
with the data, the attributes of the data and the time convention follow a
common standard for all the different data types within the WOCE Global Data
set, and also are common to other data sets that are used by the oceanographic
 and meteorology communities.<br>
