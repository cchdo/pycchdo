    <p>
      The original goal of the Carina data synthesis project was to create a merged
      calibrated data set from open ocean subsurface measurements by European
      scientists that would be generally useful for biogeochemical investigations
      in the North Atlantic and in particular, studies involving the carbon system.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      Over time the geographic extent expanded to include the entire Atlantic, the
      Arctic and the Southern Ocean and the international collaboration broadened
      significantly. Details of this project will be described in a special issue
      of ESSD, 2009. The files in this table contain the original measurements, but
      all units have been converted to "WOCE standard" and all parameters have been
      assigned WOCE flags. All files are Exchange format.
