    <p>
      Recent CTD data from the upper 2000 meters of all ice-free areas of the
      World Ocean provide the most reliable salinity correction data for the vast
      number of temperature and salinity profiles generated by the ca. 3000
      free-drifting profiling floats of the
      <a href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/">international Argo program</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Float salinity corrections are periodically updated. Hence rapid receipt of
      new CTD data is extraordinarily valuable to the Argo community. The CCHDO
      has teamed with Argo to provide a single site for data providers to submit
      proprietary CTD data which are not public, and which are to be used only
      for Argo data correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The CCHDO does not post such data on its public web site, but instead sees
      that only the appropriate Argo data center receives them. The CCHDO will
      not make "for Argo only" data public without the consent of the data
      provider.
