  {% call h.boxed('An Improved Exchange Format for WOCE Hydrographic Program Data Files') -%}
    <p>The original WHP formats for both CTD and bottle data have been a problem
    to produce. The descriptions are vague, leading to inconsistencies that have
    caused difficulties for both the WHPO and data users.</p>

    <p>We have created a self-describing data exchange format, combining the most
    relevant information from the summary (*.SUM) files with the parameter names,
    units and values from the CTD and bottle files. The result is a single,
    sensible, comma separated value ASCII file for each data type that should
    alleviate the problems asscociated with reading the WOCE hydrographic
    data.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

      <li><a href="/static/information/formats/exchange/example_ct1.csv">An example CTD file</a></li>
      <li><a href="/static/information/formats/exchange/example_hy1.csv">An example bottle file</a></li>
