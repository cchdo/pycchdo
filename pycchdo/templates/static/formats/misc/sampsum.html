      <p>(<b>Includes Country Code, Ship Code, Expedition Designation/Leg</b>)
      Due to the number of cruises involved, a unique identifier is required for
      all WOCE cruises.  To provide such identification, please use the following
      procedure to form the requisite Mnemonic.</p>
      <p>The first 4 characters are the US National Oceanographic Data Center
      (NODC) country ship code.  The US NODC country codes are defined in Table
      3.6.  Note that the country code is associated with the country of origin
      for the ship.  That may be different from the country actually conducting
      the cruise.  The US NODC ship code can normally be obtained from OCEANIC.
      If you cannot obtain the ship code from there, the WHPO can provide the
      proper code for you.</p>
      <p>The country-ship code is followed by up to an 8 character expedition
      name or cruise number and the leg (default = 1) of the cruise is appended
      after the _ (underscore) symbol.  The expedition name or cruise number is
      normally assigned by the ship operator and their conventions should be
      used.  For example, German cruises are designated by a number and leg while
      French cruises are usually given a name.  Thus, a name should not be given
      in the EXPOCODE for a German cruise.  Further, some countries designate
      their cruises by a number but that number is reset to 1 every year.  In
      such cases the year should be included with the cruise number, for example,
      the 9th cruise of the R/V <i>A. von Humboldt</i> in 1991 would be given
      cruise number 991 in the EXPOCODE to ensure uniqueness.</p>
      <p>An alias for the cruise may be fiven in the -.DOC file and will be
      retained with the netadata for the cruise.  For formatting reasons, the
      expedition name is limited toeight (8) characters.  Therefore, if
      necessary, the expedition name should be abbreviated to 8 characters for
      the EXPOCODE, but will be carried full length with the metadata.  The
      EXPOCODE is also used in the water sample (-.SEA) and -.CTD files to tie
      these files to the -.SUM file in order to uniquely identify the cruise or
      expedition in those files.</p>

      <p>The WHP Section designator.  Section designations were originally
      assigned in the WOCE Implementation Plan.  However, many sections have been
      added or modified since then.   If you have a question about the section
      designation for the work that you are doing, please contact the WHPO.</p>
      <p>Many one-time sections are broken into segments that are often done by
      different invesigators on different ships.  To account for this the WHPO
      frequently assigns suffixes to the section designator to distinguish among
      these segments.  The same is true for some repeat sections as well.  If a
      suffix has been assigned to your segment (this information is available
      from the WHPO or via OCEANIC) it would be appreciated if that
      identification is included in the WHP-ID.  Also, in order for sort routines
      in a database to work correctly it is necessary that all section numbers be
      the same length, which requires a leading zero for single digit sections.
      That is, section P1 sould be written as P01, AR5, is AR05, and so on.</p>
      <p>If stations are taken on a cruise that are not associated with a WHP
      section then this field should be left blank in the -.SUM file.</p>

      <p>Whenever possible the station numbering should be continuous for each
      section, i.e., station numbers should not be reset at the beginning of each
      leg of long WHP cruises carried out with multiple legs.  Repeat and time
      series cruises often use the same station number(s) on sequential cruises
      and that presents no difficulties as long as each cruise is given a unique
      EXPOCODE.  In order to guage the accuracy of the station position we ask
      that position, time, and the uncorrected depth be given in the -.SUM file
      for the beginning, bottom, and end of every hydrographic cast.  That allows
      an estimate of the ship drift during the station and whether or not the
      ship drifted across significant topography during the station.</p>

      <p>The cast numbers are sequential and preferably numbered from 1 to n at
      each station position. Every over-the-side operation or discrete sampling
      at a station is assigned a sequential cast number.  The cast type is a
      three-character description, for example, ROSette water samples plus CTD
      (ROS), Large Volume Samples (LVS); CTD only (CTD) including fast fish CTD
      launches; etc. A complete list of cast types is given in Table3.5. If any
      other abbreviations for cast types are necessary an explanation and
      definition of such abbreviations must be included in the cruise report
      (.DOC file) and in the text file accompanying the CTD and water sample data
      file.</p>
      <p>If a station is reoccupied during the same cruise, and the same station
      number is used, the cast numbers should increment upward from the last cast
      number at the same station. In no case should two records in the .SUM file
      contain the same STNNBR and CASTNO on the same cruise.</p>
