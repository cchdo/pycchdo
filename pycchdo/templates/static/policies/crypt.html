    <p>
      Non-public data on this site are ASCII encrypted using Phil Zimmerman's 
      <b>PGP</b>
      (<b>P</b>retty <b>G</b>ood <b>P</b>rivacy) software.  We chose this method of encryption 
      since it is the best public domain, multi-platform software of its kind available today.
      All "keys" (or passwords) are created by the WHP Office and are jointly held by the Office and each
      of the principal investigators listed in the tables associated with each cruise.
    </p>
    <p>
      To decrypt each file, contact the investigator directly to get the key
      and/or permission to use their data. If the investigator does not have
      the key, but gives permission to use the data, the WHP Office will send a
      decrypted version of the data file to the requestor.

       Frankly, this is an experiment.  The PGP software is available for nearly
       all modern computer operating systems, but we are not permitted to
       distribute the PGP software ourselves. If you do obtain the proper
       permissions to use a file but are unsuccessful in decrypting it, please
       contact {{ questions_for_steve(False) }}
       for further assistance.
