    <p>The EXPOCODE is the expedition code, assigned by the CCHDO (sometimes
    changed to match required syntax from a preliminary EXPOCODE generated by the
    data originator). A single alphanumeric word, without spaces, commas, or "/"
    characters (but "_" underscore characters are OK) which is a unique cruise
    identifier code, is required for every cruise dealt with by the CCHDO.</p>

    <p>ExpoCodes created after January 2006 will have the following format:</p>

    <p>NODCShipCodeYearMonthDay</p>

    <h2>Example derivation</h2>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Ship Name</th><td>Roger Revelle (<a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/General/NODC-Archive/platformlist.txt">NODC Ship Code</a>: 33RR)</td>
      <tr><th>Cruise start date</th><td>March 29, 2009 (2009-03-29)</td>
      <tr><th>ExpoCode</th><td>33RR20090329</td>
    </table>

    <p>
      ExpoCodes created before January 2006 will keep their established name,
      but will also be discoverable by the newer style ExpoCode.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cruise start date - Official ship's log date of departure.

    If ship has an emergency return to port then continues the cruise, use
    original date whether or not stations were occupied before the emergency.
    </p>
    <p>
    If departure date is unknown, date of first station can be used. Beware of
    shakedown station complications. Note all relevant information related to
    this alternate day in the documentation.
