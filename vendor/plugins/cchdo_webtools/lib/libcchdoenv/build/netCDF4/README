Python/numpy interface to the netCDF version 4 library.

Quick Start
-----------

make sure numpy (at least version 1.2.1) is installed.
make sure HDF5 (at least version 1.8.4 patch level 1) and netcdf-4 (at least version 4.1.1)
are installed.   
'python setup.py install' installs the netCDF4 and netcdftime modules.
The environment variables HDF5_DIR and NETCDF4_DIR can be 
set to point to the locations of the HDF5 and netcdf-4 libraries and
headers before setup.py is run. If they are not, some standard locations
will be searched.

If HDF5 was built with szip support, you may also need to set the
SZIP_DIR environment variable to point to the locations of the szip
libraries and headers.

If you can't install the HDF5 and netcdf-4 libs on your system,
but have netcdf-3 installed, set NETCDF3_DIR to point to the
location of the netcdf-3 library and headers, and then run
'python setup-nc3.py install'. This will install the netCDF3 module.
If you don't set NETCDF3_DIR, some standard locations will be searched.

To install just the pure-python netcdftime module, 
run 'python setup-netcdftime.py install'

Unit tests are in the 'test' directory.
To run all the tests, execute 'cd test; python run_all.py'.
Tests for the netCDF3 module are in the 'test3' directory.
Additional examples are in the 'examples' directory.
